### **Course Description:**

At the heart of every Data Science project exists the planning, design and execution of experiments. Such experiments aim at understanding the data, potentially cleaning it and performing the necessary data analysis for knowledge discovery and decision-making. Without knowing the experimental design processes that are used in practice, researchers may not be able to discover what is really hidden in their data. The first aim of this course is to look at existing experimental designs that take into account the questions that need to be answered as well as the nature of the data and the different parameters used by algorithms. Subsequently, the course will introduce different qualitative and quantitative methods to assess the quality of the results. 

All concepts will be accompanied by examples and the students will have practical exercises and projects in which they will demonstrate their knowledge. 

### **Prerequisites:**
• INF 1344H: Introduction to Statistics for Data Science

• INF 1340H: Programming for Data Science. 
### **Course Structure**

Three (3) in-class hours per week will be divided into lectures and tutorials, in which we discuss and further probe topics covered in the lectures and readings. Note that for every one (1) hour of class time, students can expect to do 3 hours of reading and preparation work on their own, outside class. 

**Groups**: In order to simulate how data science projects are carried out in industry in reality, students will be assigned to groups in the first couple of weeks of the course. These groups will work on the completion of all assignments related to the semester long group project.

**All coursework will be available on Quercus with detailed instructions and submission deadlines (date/time). There will also be an announcement section, which students should be responsible for checking regularly.** 

### **Topics:**

This course will follow the best principles in human-centered data science as we seek to understand the relationship between research questions, hypothesis testing and experimental design from a quantitative perspective. From a more qualitative perspective, we will discuss, critique and identify challenges and opportunities in modern experimental design, especially those conducted in industry including big tech, healthcare and others. In addition, we will simulate data science project teams by having student groups do a semester long project centered around data science with actual human/social impact. Some suggested topics are:

- Research questions and research design.
- Statistical hypothesis testing
- Linear and logistic regression
- ANOVA 
- Introduction to sampling and experiments
- Experimental contrasts
- Block experimental designs
- Factorial experimental design
- Within-subjects experimental design

### **Learning Objectives:**

### **Upon successful completion of the Experimental Design course, students will be able to:** 

1. ### Understand the importance of experimental design and the use of statistics in data science projects

1. ### Become familiar with the typical experimental designs used in practice

1. ### Choose an appropriate experimental design based on the given data science project

1. ### Execute a selected experimental design

1. ### Analyze the results collected after performing experiments

1. ### Interpret the experimental results and produce corresponding reports
###

**Relationship to Master of Information (MI) Program-Level Student Learning Outcomes:**

Master of Information Program-Level Student Learning Outcomes can be found [here](https://ischool.utoronto.ca/areas-of-study/master-of-information/). 

Conducting experiments is an integral part of every Data Science project. The students in INF2178H will be exposed to the main steps and theoretical foundations of defining the appropriate steps for performing successful experiments (**Outcome 1**). Apart from conducting qualitative experiments, the practical examples of the course will combine theoretical foundations with practical approaches, such that the students can respond to the changing parameters as well as the size and variety of the given data (**Outcome 4**). By employing statistical metrics and evaluation criteria they will be able to provide robust qualitative and quantitative interpretations of experimental results. At the same time they will learn and apply the principles of providing reproducible solutions (**Outcome 5**). Finally, the course will allow students to develop their own goals and continue in life-long intellectual growth beyond graduation (**Outcome 6**). 


**Class Format**

The course will consist of lectures, class discussions, and tutorials. Students are expected to attend the classes and to actively participate in the discussions and tutorials. For each class, a series of topics are provided to guide students through the readings and activities, and to frame the lectures, discussions, and studios.

Teaching and learning is a shared responsibility, influenced by individual knowledge and experience, and achieved through expanding our awareness of the different issues and approaches involved in information architecture. Commitment, preparation, and active participation are important ingredients to realize this goal. Your preparation and participation are important to your learning and the learning of your colleagues.

All the course materials will be available on the University of Toronto learning management system (Quercus) together with assignments and announcements.

The essence of academic life revolves around respect not only for the ideas of others, but also their rights to those ideas and their promulgation. It is therefore essential that all of us engaged in the life of the mind take the utmost care that the ideas and expressions of ideas of other people always be appropriately handled, and, where necessary, cited. For writing assignments, when ideas or materials of others are used, they must be cited. APA format is suggested, however you may use any formal citation format you are familiar with, as long as it is used consistently in your paper, the source material can be located and the citation verified. What is most important is that the material be cited. In any situation, if you have a question, please post it to QUERCUS. Such attention to ideas and acknowledgment of their sources is central not only to academic life, but life in general. 

**Accommodations:**

Students with diverse learning styles and needs are, of course,  welcome in this course. If you have a disability or a health consideration that may require accommodations, please feel free to approach Student Services and/or the Accessibility Services Office (<http://www.studentlife.utoronto.ca/as>) as soon as possible. The Accessibility Services staff are available by appointment to assess needs, provide referrals and arrange appropriate accommodations. The sooner you let them know your needs, the quicker they can assist you in achieving your learning goals in this course.

**Participation and Attendance:**

Students Discussion and interaction in the classes are an important ways to learn. Sharing your experiences and ideas with your classmates is central to your learning experience in this course. As such, you should attend and participate in every class. There will also be exercises and discussions that you will participate in within your groups in your class. Some of the activities will be very helpful in completing your assignments.**  

**Regrading Policy:**

This is primarily a project-based course and as such, usual re-grading policies regarding assignment submission do not apply. Students and/or groups may reach out to the instructor and TA on an ad hoc basis to inquire about their course performance and progress. Instructors and TAs should ensure all communications with the student is in writing (e.g. follow-up e-mail) and keep a copy for later reference.**
